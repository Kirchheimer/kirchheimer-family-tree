## About the Kirchheimer Family

The Kirchheimer family traces its origins to Jewish communities in what is now Germany. The name "Kirchheimer" was adopted in 1809, when the Jewish community of Kirchheim was required to formalize their identities under Napoleonic rule.

This repository aims to document all branches of the family and preserve their contributions for future generations.
